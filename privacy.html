      <p>
        The password generator runs entirely in your browser using the Web Crypto API. No passwords,
        configuration options, or personal data are sent to our servers. We do not create user
        accounts and do not maintain server-side logs that can be tied to individual visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect only minimal, aggregated telemetry such as page views to understand overall usage.
        This information cannot be used to identify you and is not combined with advertising data.

    <section aria-labelledby="clipboard-usage">
      <h2 id="clipboard-usage">Clipboard usage</h2>
      <p>
        When you click the <strong>Copy</strong> button, the generated password is written to your
        local clipboard through the standard Clipboard API. The password never leaves your device,
        and we do not receive or store clipboard contents. You can clear your clipboard at any time
        by copying different text.
      </p>

    <section aria-labelledby="ads">
      <h2 id="ads">Advertising and consent</h2>
      <p>
        We participate in the Google AdSense program to fund maintenance of this tool. Personalized
        advertising is only enabled after you provide consent through our Google-certified Consent
        Management Platform (CMP). Until consent is recorded, only non-personalized ads are served.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CMP banner explains how to update your preferences or withdraw consent. You can revisit
        those controls at any time by selecting the “Privacy &amp; cookie settings” link that appears in
        the banner and in the site footer.
      </p>

    <section aria-labelledby="partners">
      <h2 id="partners">Ad partners</h2>
      <p>
        Our primary advertising partner is Google AdSense, which may rely on Google Marketing
        Platform and other certified vendors to deliver ads. When you opt in to personalized ads,
        Google may use cookies or local storage to tailor content. You can review how Google uses
        data and manage their cookies at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google Ads privacy</a>.
