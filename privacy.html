      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the website at secure-password-generator.com handles information when you use the free, client-side password generator. The tool is designed to keep your data on your device, and this document outlines what we do and do not collect.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="no-passwords">
      <h2 id="no-passwords">Data we do not collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not store, log, or transmit any passwords generated by the tool.</strong> All generation happens locally in your browser, and nothing you type or create is sent to a server.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="minimal-data">
      <h2 id="minimal-data">Data that may be collected</h2>
      <p>When you visit the site, standard web server information may be collected automatically, such as IP address, browser and device details, timestamps, and pages visited. This limited data is used only for security, performance monitoring, and basic usage metrics to keep the service reliable.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="third-parties">
      <h2 id="third-parties">Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The site is hosted on Netlify. We may also use optional, privacy-friendly analytics services (such as Netlify Analytics or Cloudflare Web Analytics) that do not rely on tracking cookies. No generated passwords are ever sent to these providers.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="cookies">
      <h2 id="cookies">Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>This site does not use advertising or tracking cookies. If privacy-focused analytics are enabled, they are configured to be cookie-free. Should essential technical cookies be introduced in the future, they will be disclosed in the Cookies page.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="legal-basis">
      <h2 id="legal-basis">Legal basis for processing</h2>

    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="retention">
      <h2 id="retention">Data retention</h2>
      <p>Hosting and analytics providers retain server logs only for as long as necessary to provide their services and meet security or legal requirements, in line with their default policies. We do not keep additional copies.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="rights">
      <h2 id="rights">Your rights</h2>
